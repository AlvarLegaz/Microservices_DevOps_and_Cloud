- Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard. 
- Install MongoDB as service and create the paths of Data directory and Log directory.
- You can also install **MongoDB Compass**, a graphical tool for managing MongoDB.

## 2. Data Folder  
- Inside the `data` folder, create another folder named `db` (e.g., `C:\data\db`). This will be the location where MongoDB stores data.
